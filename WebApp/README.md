# CivicSync

## 1. App Overview & Objectives

The *Crowdsourced Civic Issue Reporting and Resolution System* bridges the gap between citizens and municipal organizations. It empowers citizens to report issues (potholes, streetlights, trash, etc.) quickly, while enabling municipal staff to categorize, prioritize, and resolve them efficiently. AI/rule-based systems will help automate urgency and routing, and a community section will drive citizen engagement.

*Core Objectives:*

* Empower citizens to easily report civic issues.
* Provide municipalities with a structured, prioritized dashboard.
* Enhance civic engagement through a community-driven platform.
* Improve transparency, accountability, and sponsor visibility.

## 2. Target Audience

* *Phase 1 Citizens*: Primarily Gen Z (tech-savvy, socially conscious, early adopters).
* *Municipal Staff*: Admins, department staff, and field workers.
* *Secondary Users*: Sponsors, NGOs, and the general public via a web-facing portal.
